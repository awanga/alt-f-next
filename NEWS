=== October 13, 2017: Alt-F-1.0 is released

Hi,

I'm pleased to announce Alt-F-1.0.

Alt-F has now more than seven years old, is stable since several releases ago,
and is even showing some grey hairs, so it would be unfair to not make a 1.0 release.
Here it is!

In this release most, if not all, issues reported by users that tested the RC6 and 1.0
Snapshots are fixed, and most pre-installed packages have been updated to their last released version.

It was thoroughly tested on a DNS-323 rev-A1/B1, a DNS-325 rev-A1, a DNS-320L rev-A1
 and a DNS-327L rev-A1 boxes.

Please read until the end, particularly the Firmware upgrading instructions,
enjoy and report any issue,
João

News:
===

-updated to linux kernel 4.4.86
 -Hardware accelerated crypto device: mv-cesa driver replaced by newer marvell-cesa.
  Not working on the DNS-321/323.
 -iscsitarget not supported for new kernel.
 -The USB UAS support has been removed from the kernel, as it causes issues with certain
  (mostly Seagate) USB disk enclosures.
 -wireless USB network drivers are available in the kernel-modules-armvx package.

-update to samba-3.6.25, which supports SMB2
 The "Samba Setup" webUI now allows enabling or disabling SMB1 and/or SMB2.
 After changing it in the webUI, if needed, the client user might have to logout or reboot the PC.
 Most SMB2 enabled clients will use SMB2 if available, and might have lower thougput than SMB1.
 Notice that most embeded devices and linux clients need SMB1.

-A new service and webUI, 'rmount' (Remote Mount), is now available.
 It is intended to mount remote NFS and CIFS filesystems at start.
 It basicaly consists of the "Import Remote Filesystem" in the NFS and SMB webUIs.

-A new service, 'nsm' (Network Status Monitor) is available.
 It is automaticaly used by the nfs and rmount services.

-The "Setup Host" webUI handle host name and IP changes more friendly.
 There are still issues when using https, as for security the browser refuses to accept
 the new name or IP.
 User supplied name servers are now honored.

-The SSL self-signed certificates for https usage now uses subjectAltName in addition to CN.

-dnsmasq removed from the base firmware on the DNS-321/323

-Entware-ng install, package management and services start and stop webUIs

-The fan speed can use disk temperatures into account if the hddtemp service is running.
 catch: Disks will not spin down because the drive is constantly being pooled for its temperature.

-DNS-320/321/323/325: the power button now powers off the box if released during the first
 3 seconds and reboots the box if released during the next 3 seconds.

Know issues:
=======

-DNS-323/321: You have to flash 1.0 if still in RC4.1 or previous, TryIt mode does not works.
 If however you want to Tryit first, you have to use the following command to try 1.0 before
 hitting the TryIt button:
 echo "console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 init=/init earlyprintk kexecmode" > /boot/cmdline

- when partitioning new disks with GPT using the web interface, only the first position in the partitions
 table is editable (no problem when disk is set to MBR).
 Actually, the cursor is not shown but if number are typed they will appear.

-The webUI red warning "When done you must save settings" is diaplayed warning for a changed
 /etc/samba/smbpasswd, even if it is not changed.

-if using DDNS  under Services->Network->ddns, re-configure because of configuration changes

-The Alt-F Package Manager might display erroneous information, as the fw contains packages
 that have not yet been released.

-Packages that was preinstalled on previous releases and that now are not preinstalled,
 will appear as installed under the Package Manager webUI; they can be safely removed.

Firmware upgrading instructions:
==================

-Reboot the box before performing any upgrade.

-Look at the box bottom attached label to see its hardware revision
 level, then select the appropriate Alt-F-1.0 bin file and
 use the normal firmware upgrade method to flash it.
 For example, the Alt-F-1.0-DNS-320-rev-Ax.bin file is to be used
 on the DNS-320 on any rev-A1, A2 or A3 box.
 Don't try to flash firmware if your box is not supported.

-When alternating between D-Link and Alt-F firmware clear the browser cache.
 The box name and IP might also change, consult your router DHCP client/lease page,
 or a network scanner program (Fing on Android, e.g.) to determine the new box IP.

-If you are already using Alt-F:
 -make sure that both the HTTP and HTTPS admnistrative servers
  are in "inetd mode", not in "server mode". Use Services->Network, http, Configure.
 -Use http to access the box webUI for the upgrade.
 -Save current settings to a desktop computer (System->Settings, in the
   "Computer Disk" section, "Save current settings to file" hit the Download button)
 -if using Alt-F-0.1RC5 or latter
  -download also the firmware associated sha1 file and in the
   Firmware Upgrader webUI supply it along with the firmware bin file in order to
   verify the firmware download integrity.
  -Unapply the "network corruption fix" after flashing 1.0 using
   Services->User, user, Configure, clear the "Script to execute on powerup" entry and Submit.
 -If running the 1.0 Snapshot, execute the following commands after flashing the 1.0 Release,
  in order to update the pre-installed packages list:
  rm /usr/lib/ipkg/.fixed
  ipkg -update
 
=== June 25, 2016: Alt-F-0.1RC5 is released

Known issues:
-On the Firmware Upgrade webUI of previous releases the TryIt button will not be able to try
 this release, you have to flash it.
-https, provided through stunnel, can fail the first time when in server mode; 
 stopping and restaring the stunnel service is usually enough to recover.
-The webUI does not supports disks reporting 4KB logical sector size;
 disks with 4KB physical sector size and reporting 512 bytes logical sizes, the majority, works fine.
-when upgrading some packages (rsync) its configuration files might be overwritten
-When using https the webUI can't embed some external or running services http web pages
 (and most https servers disable embedding for security reasons)
-smartd now displays errors on the Status page, but migh fail on its first start,
 use Submit in Services->System->smart->Configure to fix.
-kexec is not working on the 320/320L/325 (it fails even on linux-4.3.0)
-Debian in kexec mode only works on the DNS-321/323
-the iscsitarget package is not working on the DNS-327 and generates BUG kernel errors on other boxes.
-the cryptodev package is not working on the DNS-327
-to upgrade the kernel-modules package, the kernel-modules-armv5 package must be installed first
-the kernel-modules package don't automatically install/un-install the appropriate
 kernel-modules-armv5 or kernel-modules-armv7 package, you have to install/un-install them.
-If upgrading from previous releases, the ntp package will appear as installed, it can safely be removed.

=== February 3, 2015: Alt-F-0.1RC4.1 is released

This is mainly a maintenance release, with all fixes for the RC4 applied
and with some other minor fixes and improvements.
All users are encouraged to upgrade.

The DNS-320L/LW-rev-Ax and the DNS-320-rev-Bx support is now complete.
The circuit boards for the DNS-320L-rev-Ax and DNS-320-rev-Bx are
identical apart from a smaller amount of memory in the DNS-320-rev-Bx,
so any of them can use the other firmware.

If you are running the vendor's firmware you don't have to follow the
bellow described procedure.

If however you have flashed 0.1RC4 or the experimental releases and
applied any fix or patch, you have to manually removed them before upgrading.
In the future this will happens automatically when upgrading, but for now
you have to save and execute a file in the box. Rolling fixes back might
not work as expected.
You also have to disable the "boot user script" if you are using it to apply
any fix or patch to the DNS-320-rev-Bx or to the 320L/LW-rev-Ax boxes.

Create a file with the text between the two '-----------' lines below,
being sure that #!/bin/sh is at the file first line and column. Then
telnet or ssh the box and login as the 'root' user using the same
password as in the webUI and execute it by typing in the command line:

dos2unix /path/to/saved/file
sh /path/to/saved/file

e.g. if you named the file 'fix' and saved it in '/mnt/sda2':

dos2unix /mnt/sda2/fix
sh /mnt/sda2/fix


-----------8<---------
#!/bin/sh
if aufs.sh -s; then
 aufs.sh -n
 for i in $(find /rootmnt/ro /rootmnt/sqimage -type f 2> /dev/null | sed "s|^/rootmnt/[^/]*/||"); do
  if test -f /Alt-F/$i && ! grep -q $i /etc/settings /usr/lib/ipkg/info/*.list; then
   rm -f /Alt-F/$i
  fi
 done
 aufs.sh -r
fi
---------->8---------

Some relevant user-related changes since RC4:

-add temperature hysteresis parameter
-make fanctl() implement several fan control modes (Auto/always off/always slow/always fast)
-exchange left/right bay for DNS320L
-parse drive family/model name with embeded quotes
-turn the blue USB led off only when there are no USB attached devices
-don't turn on usb led by default
-handle xz compressed debian packages
-activate disk leds on disk access;
-support ppp and usb attached device names
-support swap over RAID
-create directories for fixe affected files so fixes will they survive a reboot/poweroff
-download only new fixes
-rollback fixes if they were removed from the repository
-don't allow rollbacking a fix if it is required by an applied fix
-add fixes RemoveAll button
-sys utils: don't fail if the System Configuration log is not found
-Mail webUI: sanitize "from/to" entries
-inetd webUI: fix ticket 328: Inetd "Boot Enabled" disables itself.
-Disk Wizard: fix ticket 358: Disk Wizard fails creating RAID with 6TB disks
-Filesystem Maintenance: fix display of unmounted devices
-backup: allow excluding files/directories by using .rsync-filter files, using '-F --delete-excluded' rsync options

=== June 24, 2014: Alt-F-0.1RC4 is released

-The DNS-320/325 is now supported. Supported devices are the DNS-320-rev-A1/A2, DNS-321-rev-A1/A2,
 DNS-323-rev-A1/B1/C1, DNS-325-rev-A1/A2, Conceptronic CH3SNAS, and Fujitsu-Siemens DUO 35-LR

-Preliminary support for the DNS-320L/LW-A1, thanks to Steven Samson collaboration and
 Andreas Böhler work (http://www.aboehler.at/cms/projects-a-hacks/50-dns320l).
 More work is needed, please report any issue.

-All packages in the base firmware updated, most require RC4, upgrade to RC4 to use them.
 As such, all Disk-installable packages must be updated (Packages->Alt-F, UpdatePackagList, then UpdateAll)
 As there are almost 200 packages available, only the most used ones have been tested.
 Please use https://sourceforge.net/p/alt-f/_list/tickets for bug reports or requests.

-Most packages in the base firmware are now individually upgradable on disk, avoiding the need
 for a new Alt-F release whenever any of those packages has a new release.

-For the DNS-320/321/325 some packages are pre-installed in the firmware.
 You still HAVE TO CREATE A USER (Setup->Users) and SETUP ALT-F PACKAGES (Packages->Alt-F) on disk.

-The build system has been extensively reviewed and tested on openSUSE-12.1/13.1 and on Debian 7.0.

-Package updates, fixes, releases, as well as Announcements, are checked twice a week and shown
 in the Status page through the News service (Services->System). It has nothing to do with USENET News.

-There is the possibility of applying simple fixes using the webUI, avoiding the need
 for a new Alt-F release (System->Utilities->Fixes).
 If the "News" service is running you will be warned of the fixes existence in the Status page.

-The linux kernel 3.10.32 is now used.

-The reloaded/run-on-top mode has been discontinued

-The inady DDNS client has been replaced by inadyn-mt, which supports 14 DDNS providers

-Added Disk and Users Quotas webUI

-The Status pages now has a Errors/Warning section

-The ftp server can be launched standalone (not under inetd control).

-Themable webUI

-Simple ffp services start/stop control

-Setup->Host Samba related items moved to Samba Setup

-Added Samba online help.

-Most known bugs are fixed.

-Setup->Debian now installs "wheezy"

known issues:

-kexec is not working on the DNS-320/325, no TryIt in Firmware Update nor Debian kexec (only chroot)
-starting Transmission deploy a "save settings" warning on the DNS-320/325
-leds might work differently than described on different hardware revision boards
-the transmitted/received bytes on the Status page wraps to zero at 4GB

=== March 23, 2013: Alt-F-0.1RC3 is released

One year after 0.1RC2 and three years after 0.1B1, I'm pleased to announce 0.1RC3.
This will be the last release before the final 1.0.

This release has many bug fixes, some improvements and a few new things

Use https://sourceforge.net/projects/alt-f to download it

-Before upgrading to RC3, remove the stunnel package, now part of the
 base firmware, as well as all packages that overrides the base firmware
 in RC2, such as samba, samba-extra, vsftp, gptfdisk...

-After upgrading to RC3, and if you are using DHCP, then use Setup->Host
 to update the configuration for new DHCP features (always request the
 same IP and supply the current host name to the DHCP server)   

After one year I just don't remember all made changes. The most recent and noteworth:

-The DNS-321 is now supported, thanks to Matt Hayden.
 Instead of flashing Alt-F, you can try first to use the "reloaded" method (untested).

-There is firmware available for the Conceptronics-CH3SNAS and the
 Fujitsu-Siemens DUO35LR, ready to be flashed using the boxes Firmware
 Upgrade pages. 

-The linux kernel is now compiled for execution speed instead of space saving.

-When Alt-F is flashed, the root filesystem runs directly from flash
 memory, saving 6.5MB of memory (a 10% saving!)

-Ethtool has been removed from the base firmware and is now an independent package.

-The Folder Browser now can rename folders, has a faster Flat View mode,
 supports non western languages, and has a progress meter for the copy
 and move operations.

-The Status page shows the box hardware Backup and fsck errors, and the box  

-A few Backups fixes, creating log files that shows on the Status Page on error

-SWAT is not embedded in frames anymore (security http://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2013-0213)

-Some fixes to the Alt-F and ffp Package Manager pages

-The ffp Package Manager now supports installing both ffp-0.5 and ffp-0.7

-Bookmarking now works for embedded pages

-stunnel is now part of the base firmware, meaning that secure http is
 now available of the shelf for the administrative web pages (including SWAT)

-The httpd configuration web page now allows selecting between port 80 or 8080 for the
 administrative web server for http, or between ports 443 or 8443 for https, so the default
 80 and 443 port will be keep free for usage with the lighttpd server.

=== February 21, 2012: Alt-F-0.1RC2 is released

-All packages in the base firmware updated to the last version (but e2fsprogs and samba,
which is now at version 3.5.12; samba-3.6.3 and e2fsprogs-1.42 just don't fit
the available flash space)

This package update has subverted the Release Candidate (RC) concept,
and although care has been taken, there might exists incompatibility
with some RC1 configuration files. New users should have no problems.
No update fix script will be made available.

-Most bugs and feature requests fixed
-Most web pages are now W3c Validator compliant
-Ability to bookmark frequently accessed web pages
-New rsyncd setup web page
-New crontab setup web page
-Preliminary LVM setup web page (don't use in production!)
-Improved cryptsetup web page
-Improved mail setup web page
-Improved samba setup web page
-Restore RAID behaviour of 0.1B7
-IPv6 moved to the kernel-modules packages
-Obsolete/Updated/new disk-instalable packages (more to follow after this release):

	netatalk-2.1.6 is not supported anymore, upgrade to netatalk2.
	netatalk-2.2.2
	transmission-2.42
	fuppes-660 is back
	minidlna-1.024	
	automatic-0.7.2
	cryptsetup-1.4.1
	bridge-1.5
	pcre-8.20
	cryptodev-linux-1.0 (for hardware accelerated crypto engine)
	kernel-modules has now more drivers available

User who have an already Alt-F flashed box should use the TryIt button 
in the Firmware Upgrader web page before flashing this new version. 
Users that are using a reloaded Alt-F can proceed as above first, in order 
to try the new version without messing up with the fun_plug installation. 

=== October 13, 2011: Alt-F-0.1RC1 is released

-Alt-F can now be directly flashed using the vendor's firmware, no need for fun_plug
 (tested with D-Link firmware 1.09 on a rev-B1 hardware box)

-Support for greater then 2.2TB disks (with UEFI GPT partitioning)
 Disk Partitioner and Disk Wizard support
 Conversion from MBR to GPT and vice-versa

-Secure (https) web pages through the optional package 'stunnel'
 Both http and https are active (swat uses port 902 for https) 

-The Backup Service can now backup remote hosts using ftp/http/smb/nfs/rsync/rsyncd.
 It can even wakeup the remote host at backup time if the remote host is configured
 to be awaked-up by a network magic packet, WOL.
 Files greater than 4.2GB are not supported.

-Debian now installs into and runs from RAID

-More online-help pages

-uClibc changes for Optware compatibility. However, most Optware packages are still not usable.
 Due to the uClibc change, the recommended procedure is to update all packages 
 after upgrading to RC1 (the Alt-F_B7_to_RC1.fix script does this)

-updated packages: samba, netatalk, forked-daapd, transmission, avahi,
 cups, mdadm, rsync, smartmontools, wget, openssh, ffmpeg, hplip,
 libcurl, libpcap, libxml2, lzo, dnsmasq, dropbear, libiconv,
 msmtp, nfs-utils, ntp, netsnmp, libgcrypt,
 libgpg-error, libpcre, popt,

-samba-3.5.9 update asks for configuration file editing,
 adding "passdb backend = smbpasswd" to the Global section
 (the Alt-F_B7_to_RC1.fix script does this)
 
-Thanks to samba, now using 1/3 of flash space! the base firmware had to be compiled for
 flash memory space saving, not execution speed :-(
 -disk-installable packages are still compiled for execution speed

-new packages: gptfdisk, openvpn, cryptsetup, lvm2, iscsitarget, nut, parted,
 nmap, sysstat, bonnie++, ntfs-3g_ntfsprogs, stunnel, 

-cryptsetup initial support adds capability to LUKS format a physical partition.
 -No checks are done to see if the partition is currently in use
 -remember dm-crypt/LUKS is 3 to 4 times slower than a non encrypted partition!
 -there are some problems identifying and handling devices, cryptsetup fault,
  as it generates lots of (unnecessary?) device add/remove kernel events.

-LVM initial support, scan volume groups and and mounts physical volumes
 no web interface to create and manage them.

-LVM and cryptsetup might interfere Disk Partitioner.
 You might have to stop them manually if problems arise. 

=== March 26, 2011: Alt-F-0.1B7 is released on Alt-F first anniversary

	In the previous 12 months Alt-F has seen 6 releases, which gives an average of
	a new release every 2 months.

	During the previous year, thanks to many user reports and suggestions,
	and to many bug-fixes and improvements, Alt-F has evolved in a way that
	means that it is now mature and ready to leave the Beta status, what
	will hopefully happens in the next release.

	Online documentation, Wiki entries, packages updates and bug fixes will be the priority
	for the next release.

	Alt-F is intended to be a serious and sustainable alternative to the vendor's firmware,
	ready to be used by the average user through its administering web pages.

	Enjoy

to try the new version without messing up with the fun_plug 
installation. 
The unstable package feed was updated with new and recompiled 
packages. Most if not all new packages will only work on 0.1B7. 
The old feed is still available under the name unstable-old 
The experimental feed was deleted. 

=== December 20, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B6 Released

What's new:
	-kernel 2.6.36.2, nfs-utils back to version 1.2.1
	-terse report from vaughnd12 confirms that rev-A1 boards are now working.
	 (tanks to Philster76 and KRH for initial testing)
	-partitioning and filesystem web pages spliced and RAID web page created
	-Filesystems, RAID, and Partitioner web pages are now simpler
	-Disk Partitioner and Wizard now unconditionally aligns partitions on 4K boundaries
	-Disk Partitioner now has an advanced mode
	-Directory Browser web page with enhanced (but slow) browsing and
	 with directory copy/cut/move/create/delete capabilities
	-Directory Ownership and Access Permissions web page
	-backup support and Backup Manager administering web pages (preliminary)
	 backups local directories and directories mounted by NFS/CIFS

	-Status web page only shows what exists
	-Spaces allowed in paths in /etc/fstab and /etc/exports (use\040as\040space)
	 and processed by smb and nfs web pages. NFS complains but works.
	 mounts by filesystem labels still replace spaces with underscores.
	-Speed improvement in web pages that deals with disk
	-Countless improvements and bug fixes.

	-Users with an Alt-F flashed box should use the *TryIt* option in the Firmware
	 Updater web page before actually flashing it, as incompatibilities might happen.
	 Its Beta!

	-There are a few identified incompatibilities between B5 and B6. If you have only slightly
	changed settings, the recomended procedure is to clear settings before starting using.
	If you dont' want to clean settings, the file Alt-F_B5_to_B6.fix script tryies to fixes them.
	Before using or flashing Alt-F-01.B6, telnet/ssh the box, and execute the script.
	After doing it don't save settings until start using B6. Other incompatibilities might arise.

	I will now start updating disk-instalable packages and fix 0.1B6 reported bugs.
	No more features are expected in the base firmware, but (micro)emacs and ncurses
	will be removed and turned into packages.

	Hopefully the next release will be 0.1

	-ftp administering web page (AWP)
	-wget proxy AWP (untested)
	-disk wizard AWP
	-disk maintenance AWP redesigned, more disk/raid operations supported
	-disk partitioning AWP bugs fixed
	-remote web administration AWP (untested)
	-redesigned side menu and added drop-down menus on AWP
	-SMART AWP
	-Board revision level detection
	-several other fixes and improvements.

Known Issues:

	-Rev-A1 (try it an report) and rev-C1 hardware boards not yet supported

	-network link auto-negotiation doesn't work. As result Alt-F
	 only works when the box is connected to Gbit switches/routers
	 or network cards. 100/10Mbps switch or routers won't work.

	-ghostscrip/hplip can fail with an "Unable to get scanline 0/1" error,
	 and cups does not notices it, sending the print job to the printer,
	 which prints a black page, wasting all your cartridge ink.
	 After configure the printer in cups, DISCONNECT THE PRINTER and print
	 a test page. If in the State column of cups jobs web page, or using
	 "lpstat -p" you see a  "Unable to get scanline 0/1" message,
	 CANCEL THE PRINT JOB AND DON'T USE THAT PRINT CONFIGURATION.

	-big MTU (~>3712 bytes) cause a lot of "page allocation failure" error,
	 which impairs network performance (NFS at least)

	-nfs generates a lot of "received packet spanning multiple descriptors"
	 errors when MTU is not the same on both hosts!

	-partition sizes are not uniformly reported. Sometimes are binary based,
	 others decimal based.

	-component RAID disks hotpluging/ejecting might not do the right thing,
	 specially for raid0, JBD.

	-some web pages go back in browser history when an error is detected,
	 instead of reloading the previous page. The user must refresh the page

	-The Disk Partitioning web page is not able to re-partition disks whose
	 partitions that are not in increasing partition-start order, as the 
	 vendor's partition table are when configured for "standard disks".
	 This only happens if the user whish to keep some partition in the
	 middle of the disk unaltered. The solution is to re-partition the whole
	 disk, loosing all it data.
