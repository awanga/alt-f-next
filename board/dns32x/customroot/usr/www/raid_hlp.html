<center><h2>RAID Creation and Maintenance Help</h2></center>

RAID enables you to create a new device using other devices, usually one
or more physical devices, see <a href="diskpart_hlp.html">Disk
Partitioner</a>. Each device that a RAID is build-up will be called a
<em>RAID component</em>.<br> Being built from several physical devices,
it is possible to add redundancy to the RAID device, in the event that
one of its components fails. At any time components can be removed from
or added to a RAID device, even while it is running, easing its
maintenance and providing no system downtime.<br> This is the key to
RAID, redundancy and zero downtime; RAID is not a substitute, nor
replaces, a backup system, although a backup system can be build using
RAID.<br>

<p>There are several kinds (<em>levels</em>) of RAID, and some of them
don't deserve to be called RAID, as they provide no redundancy at all. 

<p>Alt-F enables creating, using and administering the following RAID levels:
<ul>

<li><strong>linear</strong>, also called <em>JBOD (Just a Bunch Of
Disks)</em>, presents a RAID device that is the result of concatenating
its two components, providing no redundancy at all. It is "convenient"
because it provides a large device, with a size equal to the sum of the
two components. If one of the components fails all the data that the RAID
contains might be compromised -- it is just the same as if half of a
normal disk gets damaged: depending on the damage you might be able to
recover only part of the data (and you have to be a filesystem expert to
do it).</li>

<li><strong>RAID 0</strong> comprises <em>striping</em> without parity or
mirroring.  It splits all reads and writes in turns to its two components,
doubling the throughput of a normal disk. It is used for high-performance
applications, and has no redundancy at all: if one of its components
fails all data will be lost, no matter what. The components must be of the
same size, and the resulting RAID device will have twice that size.</li>

<li><strong>RAID 1</strong> comprises <em>mirroring</em> without parity
or striping.  All writes are made in parallel to its two components, so
any of them has a exact copy of the other.  If one component fails the
data is still available in the other component. An extra live component
may be set apart as a <em>spare</em>, and will start working if any of
the active components fails. For redundancy to be effective, all
components must be of equal size and on different physical disks; the
resulting RAID device will have the same size as the smaller component.</li>

<li><strong>RAID 5</strong> comprises <em>block-level striping with
distributed parity</em>.  It splits reads and writes between two components,
as RAID 0 does, but keeps checksums of the other two components data
in a third component; components roles are not fixed, and if one of
them fails all data is available from the other two. All components
must have equal size, and the resulting RAID device size will be twice
the size of a single component. Complex management.</li>
</ul>

<p>For RAID 1 and RAID 5, if one component fails the data is still
available in the other component(s); while this happens the device is
said to be in the <em>degraded</em> state, meaning that it is working
like a regular device with no redundancy at all. You have to
<em>remove</em> the failed component from the RAID and <em>add</em> a
new component to replace the failed one. After the replacement is made,
a <em>reconstruction</em> step automatically begins, copying (for RAID
1) or rebuilding (for RAID 5) all data in the still good component(s) to
the newly added component. This can be done in a live system, without
downtime. 

<p>In Alt-F, for a physical partition to be allowed to be a RAID
component its partition type must be RAID. 

<p>A RAID device, as all other devices, can't be used directly, you have
to create a filesystem on it, see <a
href="diskmaint_hlp.html">Filesystem Maintenance</a>.

However, RAID 1 and JBOD can be built from partitions that already have a
filesystem (and data) on them. In this case, if you which to maintain the
data you should not create a filesystem on the new RAID device.

<p>In the upper <strong>RAID Creation</strong> section, you
have to select the RAID level you wish, select its components, and hit
the <strong>Create</strong> button. You have to be careful enough to
not select as a component a disk partition that is already assigned to
another RAID array -- you can check the current component usage in the
page lower section, under the <strong>Components</strong> column.<br>
You are allowed to create RAID 1 and RAID 5 devices in the degraded
state if you select less than the needed components.<br> Creating a RAID
5 device starts it in the degraded state even you specify all three
components, and the <em>recovering</em> action is automatically taken,
which can take several (tens of) hours to complete (14MB/sec). During
the recovering action the component will appear as a spare. For RAID 1
the creation behavior is similar, but the started action is
<em>resyncing</em> and no component appears as a spare. This is normal
and is the expected behavior, not an Alt-F artifact. 

<p>In the lower <strong>RAID Maintenance</strong> section, all existing
RAID devices are shown, one per line. 

<ul>
<li><strong>Dev.</strong> - the device name</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong> - the device capacity</li>

<li><strong>Level</strong> - the device RAID level. It will be in red if
the device is in the degraded state.</li>

<li><strong>Ver.</strong> the device RAID metadata version.</li>

<li><strong>Components</strong> - all device components. They will be in
red if they are in the failed state, green if they are spare components,
and black otherwise.<br> If a component is automatically marked as
failed, but you think that is OK and want to reuse it, you should perform a long
SMART test on the disk first (Disk->Utilities).</li>

<li>An action indication might appear in red, consult the Status page
for checking its evolution. </li>

<li><strong>Array</strong> - This button allows starting and stopping RAID
arrays; certain operations cannot be stopped, as they will restart
automatically. </li>

<li><strong>RAID Operations</strong><br>

The following operations can be performed on RAID 1 and RAID 5 arrays,
if the array is started and no action is occurring on it:
<ul>

<li><strong>Add/Remove bitmap</strong> - adds or removes the "write-intent
bitmap", that makes resyncing much faster.<br>
By default Alt-F creates RAID devices with the write-intent bitmap
active. If you are using a RAID device created under the vendor's
firmware you should activate the write-intent bitmap.</li>

<li><strong>Verify</strong> - verify the consistency of the device,
comparing its components data (RAID 1) and its checksums (RAID 5)</li>

<li><strong>Repair</strong> - verify the consistency of the device and try
to fix any inconsistency found</li>

<li><strong>Enlarge</strong> - make the device occupy the maximum available
space from its components. Useful after adding or replacing components
with others of greater capacity. You should Enlarge the contained
filesystem afterwards. </li>

<li><strong>Shrink</strong> - shrink the device to the minimum needed to
hold the filesystem it contains. You should Shrink the contained
filesystem before shrinking the device. </li>

<li><strong>Destroy</strong> - destroy the RAID device and the RAID information
contained in its components. You will not be able to access the data
it contains afterwards.<br> For RAID 1 with metadata version 0.9 and 1.0, however,
your data will still be available in each of the previous RAID components,
and you can mount and use them using the Disk->Filesystem web page. </li>

</ul></li>

<li><strong>Component Operations</strong><br>
The following <strong>Component Operations</strong> can be performed on
RAID 1 and RAID 5 arrays, after selecting the desired component under
<strong>Partition</strong>

<ul>

<li><strong>Fail</strong> - deliberately fail a component, in order to
remove (or re-add) it afterwards. It will be marked as failed (in red)
in the <strong>Components</strong> column.<br> Fail here means
logically, not at the hardware level, the disk itself will not be
damaged!</li>

<li><strong>Remove</strong> - remove a component from the array; it has
to be in the Fail state. </li>

<li><strong>Add</strong> - add a component to the array, e.g., to replace a
failed component or add a spare. </li>

<li><strong>Clear</strong> - clear the RAID information from the
component. This is needed if you want to use the disk partition for
other than RAID purposes, or if a component was automatically marked as
failed but you think that it is OK and you want to re-add it to device.</li>
