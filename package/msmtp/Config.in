		msmtp is an SMTP client.
		In the default mode, it transmits a mail to an SMTP server (for
		example at a free mail provider) which does the delivery.
		To use this program with your mail user agent (MUA), create a
		configuration file with your mail account(s) and tell your MUA to 
		call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail.
