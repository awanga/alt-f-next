<center><h2>Settings Management Help</h2></center>

The changes you make to Alt-F configuration, using its administrative web page, reside in memory and must be saved into non-volatile flash-memory in order to survive reboots or power-off.

<p>When configuration files are changed, a <font color=red>When done you should save settings</font> warning appears under all the web pages title, reminding you to save the changes when you are satisfied with the results; you don't have to save changes immediately. If you hold the mouse pointer on top of the warning, a popup window will show you the files that have changed and needs to be saved.

<p>The amount of available flash memory for storing settings is low, and that space is shared with the vendor's firmware settings.<br>
Alt-F doesn't delete the vendor's settings, either because they are needed to boot the box if you have not yet flashed Alt-F, or to keep your old environment in the eventuality that you decide to return to the vendor's firmware, flashing it from within Alt-F.<br>
Depending on the current Alt-F and vendor's settings, there can be not enough flash memory to save Alt-F settings when you try to do it; if this is the case, you have to decide if you still need the vendor's settings and erase them. <strong>Don't do it</strong> if you have not flashed Alt-F, or on reboot the box will behave as if a factory reset happened.

<p>In any case, when reflashing the vendor's firmware back, for the DNS-321/323, Alt-F offers you the possibility of restoring the vendor's settings from an alternative flash memory location, or in alternative to use the vendor's firmware defaults.

<p>Alt-F has an emergency/last resort way of clearing settings to default values: press and keep pressing the box back button for more than twenty seconds (both LEDs will be flashing twice a second) -- all settings will be erased and a reboot will happen. Read <a href="sysctrl_hlp.html">Temperature, Fan and Buttons Setup</a> near the end for more details.

<p>In the upper <strong>Flash Memory</strong> section, you can:
<ul>
<li><strong>SaveSettings</strong>: the current in-memory settings are saved into flash-memory. Several sets of Alt-F settings can coexist, tagged with the date and hour of the save operation; if necessary the older is deleted in order to provide space for the new set.</li>
<li><strong>LoadSettings</strong>: You have to select one of the available sets using the <strong>Select one</strong> button. The stored settings will be loaded in memory and become effective immediately; however, most running services will not recognize configuration changes until they are restarted. You might restart then all using System->Utilities->Services->RestartAll. The box IP address and name might change.</li>

<li><strong>ClearSettings</strong>: the flash-memory used to store
settings will be wiped, removing all vendor's and Alt-F settings.<br>
 
Current in-memory settings will not be cleared, and you might want to
<strong>SaveSettings</strong> afterward, or on the next reboot the box
will use Alt-F "factory" settings.<br>

Clearing settings will also clear all created users and groups (but not
their home folders), including system users and groups created by
installed packages, so you might want to <strong>Download</strong> the
current settings to your computer first, so you can examine them to
help you restore any needed settings later.<br>

If rebooted without settings, the box will first try to use a DHCP
assigned IP address, and if not successful it will try to find a free IP address in the
192.168.1.254-240 range.</li>

<li><strong>FormatFlashSettings</strong>: identical to <strong>ClearSettings</strong> above,
but the flash-memory used to store settings will also be reformated.
This has to be done when the filesystem in the flash memory is damaged and Settings can't be saved,
 listed or loaded.<br>
</ul>

<p>In the lower <strong>Computer Disk</strong> section, you can:
<ul>
<li><strong>Save current settings to file</strong>: you can store the current settings in your computer disk as a compressed tar archive using the <strong>Download</strong> button. Keep the file safe, as passwords will be available for anyone reading it.</li>
<li><strong>Load settings from file</strong>: using the <strong>Browse</strong> button you have to select  a file in your computer that you have previously saved, and hitting the <strong>Upload</strong> button, the settings will be transferred to the box and will became effective immediately; the box IP address might change.</li>
</ul>
