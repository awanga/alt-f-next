<center><h2>Temperature, Fan and Buttons Setup Help</h2></center>

<p> In the <strong>Temperature, Fan and Buttons Setup</strong> you can
configure several items that enables you to keep your box cool and not
too noisy.

<p> In <strong>System Temperature / Fan Speed relationship</strong>, you
establish how fast the fan turns, depending on the box current
temperature.<br>

<ul>
<li><h4>DNS-323 rev-A1/B1 hardware boards:</h4>

For the A1 and B1 hardware boards, the fan speed can
varies continuously between 2000 and 6500 RPM.<br>

To calibrate the fan speed with the system temperature, you must specify
a <strong>Low</strong> and a <strong>High</strong> reference point.<br>

The <strong>Low Fan Speed</strong> entry specify the desired fan speed when the
system is at the <strong>Low Temp</strong> temperature, while
the <strong>High Fan Speed</strong> entry specify the the desired fan speed when the
system is at the <strong>High Temp</strong> temperature.<br>

The low and high temperatures are not the maximum and minimum values
that you which for you box, are only reference points.

For example, with the default settings, the fan speed is 300RPM/ºC.
If the system temperature is 42 degrees, the fan will rotate at 2600 RPM.<br>

<p> In the <strong>Maximum ratings</strong>, in the <strong>Fan Off
Temp</strong> entry, you can specify at what temperature  should the fan
stop.<br>

In the <strong>Max Fan Speed</strong>, you specify the maximum fan speed
that the fan must turn at. The value depends on the characteristics of
the fan, and the manufacturer specifies between 6000 and 7000 RPM. You
should not exceed this value. </p>

<li><h4>DNS 323 rev-C1, DNS-323 rev-A1/A2, DNS-320 rev-A1 and DNS-325 rev-A1 hardware boards:</h4>

The C1 hardware board fan can only have three fan settings: off,
low speed and fast speed.<br>

In the <strong>Fan Off Temp</strong> entry, you can specify at what temperature
should the fan stop.<br>

In the <strong>Low Temp</strong> entry you specify the threshold temperature
between the low and fast fan speed: at lower temperatures the fan turns at low
speed, while at higher temperatures it turns at the fast speed.

</ul>

<p> In <strong>System Safety</strong>, you can specify a warning and
critical temperature limits of the box, as well as the full path name
of a script that you wrote and that must be executed when the box
temperature attains those limits.<br>

The default command to execute when the <strong>Critical Temperature
</strong> limit is attained, "/sbin/poweroff", makes the box shut
down.<br>

If you check the <strong>Send email</strong> checkbox, an email will be
sent when any of the temperatures limits are exceeded. The email will be
sent only once; no email will be sent if the temperature drops bellow
the setpoints.</p>

<p> In the <strong>Action to execute on Button press</strong>, you can
specify the full path name of scripts that you wrote and that must be
executed when your press the box buttons:<ol>

<li>Three seconds after you start pressing the box front button, the
right led starts flashing,  and if you release the button the box will
do a controlled reboot, but first will execute the script that you
specified in the <strong>Front button 1st cmd entry</strong>.

<li>If you keep pressing the button, the left led will start flashing,
and if you then release the button the box will do a controlled
shutdown, but first will execute  the script that you specified in the
<strong>Front button 2nd cmd entry</strong>.

<li>If you keep pressing the button, both leds will stop flashing and if
you then release the button no action will be taken.

<li>Finally, if you press the box back button for one or two seconds,
both leds will start flashing, and the script that you specified in the
<strong>Back button cmd</strong> will be executed.<br>
If no script is specified all USB mounted filesystems will be unmounted,
making it safe to remove the attached USB device. Notice that unmounting
will be unsuccessful if any service is accessing the USB filesystems.<br>

The back button also has two <em>recovery actions</em> if the
<strong>Enable Recovery</strong> checkbox is checked:<ul>

<li>If you keep the back button pressed for more than ten seconds, you
can telnet the box at port 26, as root and without password. This is a
safeguard in case you forget the password.

<li>As a last safeguard, if you press the back button for more that
twenty seconds, all the settings saved in flash will be erased, and the
box will do a controlled reboot. This is a last resort safeguard, in
case you mess the box configuration so much that you can't do anything
with it; after the reboot the box will behave as if no settings has
 ever been saved, and you have to struggle to find its IP
(if you have a DHCP server enabled in your network, the box will use it).
</ul>

</ol>
