<center><h2>Backup Server Setup Help</h2></center>

This service makes unattended backups of various types, all following the same pattern:<p>
The last made backup is compared with the folder to backup and the rsync program creates a new
backup folder based on the differences; optionaly older backup folders will be deleted.
The folder to be backup can be a local folder or a remote folder locally mounted using any of the
Backup types depicted bellow.

<p>In the page top section, <strong>Backup Destination Folder</strong> you
can see the destination folder where your backups are currently done.
<ul>
<li>You can change the current location, but it has to be located at a
filesystem root, such as /mnt/sda2 or /mnt/md0.  If you change the
location, your previous backup folder with all its contents will be
preserved, being renamed to Backup-0 (or Backup-1, if a Backup-0 folder
already exists), and the newly create Backup folder will be empty.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the page lower section, <strong>Backup Setup</strong> you can configure
scheduled backup of several types, and test them.

<p><strong>Folder</strong> is the source folder from where to make the backup.
<ul>
<li>E.g., if <strong>Folder</strong> is <code>/mnt/sda3/Music</code>, the
backup will be found in folder <code>/Backup/sda3_Music</code> with
several sub-folders named after the backup date and time, and a special
file named "current" that refers to the last backup done:

<pre>
	2011-10-03_17-56-02
	2011-10-03_17-56-45
	2011-10-03_18-08-28
	current -> 2011-10-03_18-08-28
</pre>
</li>
<li>You can browse the Backup folder using the Setup->Folder web page, or
using the Backup Samba share created for you.  All regular box users can
browse and read this share. 
</li>
<li>The first time a backup is done a full copy of the source folder is
made, and on subsequent backups only new, deleted or modified files are
updated.  Unaltered files are kept as references to the files last
version, not occupying extra space.  Thus, every backup set contains an
exact copy of the source folder at the backup time.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>When</strong> specifies the weekday to perform a backup.
<ul>
<li>0 meaning Sunday, 1-Monday, 2-Tue...  and 0,2,4 meaning every Sun,
Tue and Thu, and 0-2 meaning every Sun, Mon and Tue; * means
everyday.</li>
<li>If the first character is a 'd', then the day of the month
(1 to 31) is assumed, using the same rules, e.g. 'd1,5,10,15,20,25',
'd1-30', 'd15' are valid.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At</strong> specifies the hour when the backup is to be made,
following the same pattern as above.  Hour uses a 24 hour format. 

<p><strong>Rotate</strong> is the number of backups kept, with the
oldest being deleted after a new one is made.<ul>
<li>In the above example, if Rotate is 3, after a new backup finishes
the 2011-10-03_17-56-02 backup will be deleted. If Rotate is 0, a new
folder will be created every time the backup time arrives, until disk
space exhausts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BackupNow</strong> starts the selected backup as if the
schedule time had arrived, allowing you to test the backup; the button
will be disabled while the backup is being done.

<p><strong>Backup types:</strong>

<ul><p><li><strong>Dir</strong> - this mode of operation only backups
local folders.  For example, you can use it to backup folders from one
disk to the other.  The <strong>Run As</strong> entry should be user "root",
so the backup files original date, permissions and owners are preserved. 

<p><li><strong>NFS</strong> - this mode of operation mounts a folder from
a remote <strong>Host</strong> using NFS, then continues as in the
<strong>Dir</strong> mode.  Its purpose is mainly to create backups
from remote UNIX/Linux machines.<ul>
<li>For this mode of operation to work, there must exist user equivalence
between the user on the remote machine and a user on the box; user
equivalence means that the user and group ID should be the same on both
machines, and it is setup when the user is created.</li>
<li>Most of the time the user "root" is not allowed to be also
"root" on remote machines, so the <strong>Run As</strong> entry has to
be set to the user who owns the files on the remote machine in order
for the remote folder to be browsable and backup files to keep their
original date, permissions and owners.</li>
<li>For example, if <strong> Host</strong> is named <em>silver</em> and
<strong>Run As</strong> is <em>Joao Cardoso</em>, which has <em>jcard
</em> as its nick name, and <strong>Folder</strong> is <em>
/home/jcard/src</em> then the backup will be located in <code>
/Backup/silver_home_jcard_src/</code></li>
<li>If at the time you setup an entry of this type the remote host is
powered on, its network MAC will be retrieved and stored.  At backup time, if
the remote host is not answering, it will be sent a magic packet (WOL)
trying to power it up; setting the remote host to be powered-up in
this way is out of scope. </li>
</ul>

<p><li><strong>CIFS</strong> - this mode of operation is similar to the
NFS mode, but mounts a folder from the remote <strong>Host</strong>
using CIFS/SMB (samba).  It's purpose is mainly to create backups from
remote MS-Windows machines.<ul>
<li>For this mode of operation to work there must exist a user with the
same name and password on both machines, and the <strong>Run As
</strong> entry should be the user who owns the files to backup on the
remote machine.</li>
<li>Notice that the user name is the full MS-Windows user name, such as
<em>Joao Cardoso</em>, not the user nick name, <em>jcard</em>.</li>
<li>For Example, if <strong>Host</strong> is named <em>MONO</em> and
<strong>Run As</strong> is <em>Joao Cardoso</em>, and <strong>Folder
</strong> is <em>Users/Joao Cardoso/Music</em> then the backup will be
located in <code>/Backup/MONO_Users_Joao_Cardoso_Music/</code></li>
<li>If you try to backup a whole users folder, as above, the backup will
fail, as some files are owned by the System Administrator and the user
does not has permission to access them.</li>
<li>As in the NFS mode of operation the remote host is sent a WOL
packet if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p><li><strong>HTTP</strong> - this mode of operation keeps a local mirror
of the remote host folder, using the <em>wget</em> program, than
proceeds as in the DIR mode.  The mirror is kept between backups and is
updated before the backup is done, so only new/deleted/changed files are
downloaded.<ul>
<li>If <strong>Host</strong> is named <em>silver</em> and
<strong>Folder</strong> is <em>~jcard/ensino/LabC</em> then the backup
will be located in <code> /Backup/silver_~jcard_ensino_LabC</code>, and
the content of the backup folder will be <pre>
	2011-10-03_21-38-41
	21:37 2011-10-03_21-40-21
	current -> 2011-10-03_21-40-21
	mirror
</pre>
where <code>mirror</code> is the mirror of the remote location.</li>
<li>The only effect of <strong>Run As</strong> is that the backup
belongs to the given user.</li>
<li>This backup scheme keeps two copies of the same file, one in the
mirror folder and other in the backup folders, so it will need twice
the disk space needed by the other backup schemes.</li>
<li>Please note also that doing the backup does not means that all files
present in the remote host will be available; only the files that you
can see or download following the site pages will be downloaded.</li>
</ul>

<p><li><strong>FTP</strong> - this mode of operation is similar to the
HTTP one, except that authentication might be used if a
<code>.netrc</code> file is found in the home folder of the <strong>Run
As</strong> user.<ul>
<li>The file <code>.netrc</code> format specifies in each line a
username and a password to be used for a given host:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine &lt;host-name&gt; login
&lt;user-name&gt; password &lt;password&gt;</code><br> e.g.,
<code>machine silver login jcard password mypasswordonsilver</code></li>
<li>The file should have permissions so that nobody else can read it, use
the command<br> <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chmod og-rwx .netrc</code></li>
<li>If <strong>Host</strong> is named <em>silver</em> and
<strong>Folder</strong> is <em>win</em>, and <strong>Run As</strong> is
<em>Joao Cardoso</em>, which has <em>jcard</em> as its nick name, then
the backup will be located in <code>/Backup/silver_jcard_win</code></li>
</ul>

<p><li><strong>rsync</strong> - this mode of operation uses the
<em>rsync</em> program directly to make the backup.  It can work in two modes:
using the rsync daemon or a rsync/ssh on the remote host.
The backup script first tries to use the daemon mode, and if
unsuccessful tries the rsync/ssh mode.<ul>
<li>For the rsync daemon mode, there must exist a rsync user with the same
nick name and password in both computers, and a remote rsync daemon
must be setup first.  In the remote host a file
<em>/etc/rsyncd.secrets</em> must exist with lines of the form
<em>user:password</em> and the file <em>/etc/rsyncd.conf</em> must
contain the definition of the module to backup.<ul>
<li>The <strong>Folder</strong> entry must start with the daemon
<em>module</em> name to backup.</li>
<li>If <strong>Folder</strong> is <em>vuze/plugins</em> and a rsync
module named <em>vuze</em> exists in <strong>host</strong>
<em>silver</em>, where user <strong>Run As</strong> has permissions
to use the module and its <em>nick:password</em> is in the
<em>/etc/rsyncd.secrets</em> file, then the backup will be located in
<code>/Backup/silver_vuze_plugins</code>.</li>
</ul>
<li>In the rsync/ssh mode, password-less login using ssh cryptographic
keys has to be manually setup.<ul>
<li>If a <code>.ssh/identity</code> file is not found in the
<strong>Run As</strong> home folder, <em>ssh</em> keys will be created
for the user him and a file with instructions left in their home folder.  After
following the instructions the backup should proceed normally.</li>
<li>If <strong>host</strong> is <em>silver</em>, <strong>Folder</strong> is
<em>workspace</em> and <strong>Run As</strong> is <em>jcard</em>, then the backup
will be located in <code>/Backup/silver_jcard_workspace/</code>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
