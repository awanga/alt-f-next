<center><h2>Disk Utilities Help</h2></center>

In this page all found disks, including USB hard disks or USB flash pens, will be presented, one per line:

<ul>
<li><strong>Bay</strong> - will show you where the disk is, in the left or right box bay or on the USB port.</li>
<li><strong>Dev.</strong> - the Linux device name</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong> - as reported by the disk </li>
<li><strong>Disk Model</strong> - as reported by the disk </li>
<li><strong>Eject/Load</strong> - this button can be used with USB or internal disks. When</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eject</strong> appears, it means that some disk resource are in use by the box, and when pressing the button an attempt will be made to stop using them. If the disk is in use by some program or service and it can't be stopped, you have to stop the service or program that is using it before ejecting.</li>
<li><strong>Load</strong> appears, it means that no disk resource is in use, and you can safely remove or eject the disk. If you press the button, all supported filesystems found on the disk will be mounted and ready to be used. When a disk is plugged-in, this happens automatically.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Health</strong> - you can see the disk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T." target="_blank">S.M.A.R.T.</a> status or perform some SMART tests.</li>
You can use Services->System->smart->Configure to automate tests.
<ul>
<li><strong>Show Status</strong> - shows the disk SMART report, including disk capabilities, SMART disk attributes, and test results.</li>
<li><strong>Start short test</strong> - as the name says, selecting this performs a fast test, that will run offline (you can continue using the disk). When it finishes you can see the test result selecting <strong>Show Status</strong> and looking near the top of the <em>SMART Self-test log structure</em></li>
<li><strong>Start long test</strong> - this is similar to the short test but is more exhaustive and takes a longer time to accomplish.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Power Mode</strong> - can show <strong>StandbyNow</strong> to attempt putting the disk in standby, not spinning, or <strong>WakeupNow</strong> to take the disk out of standby. If some programs or services are using the disk, it can't be put in standby.</li>

<li><strong>Swap Priority</strong> - allows specifying the swap priority of each disk. Swap over RAID is not supported on this webUI.
On systems with low physical memory (RAM), the Operating System uses a special partition on disk to
emulate memory; when more memory is needed, the contents of a portion of RAM is moved to disk and a
portion of a previously saved memory contents on the disk is moved back to RAM -- thus the name 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging" target="_blank">swap or swapping</a>.
As disks are much slower than RAM this process slows down the overal system and can spinup the disks.
Swap <strong>is necessary</strong>, at least to allow the system to periodically check filesystem at boot time.
</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong> - no swapping will be done on this disk.</li>
<li><strong>Low</strong> - this disk will only be used for swap if a higher priority disk is available for swap and is not full.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> - same as above.</li>
<li><strong>High</strong> - same as above.</li>
</ul>
Disks with the same swap priority will be used in a round-robin mode, which provides faster swapping. This is the default.

<li><strong>Power Saving</strong> - if the disk supports A.P.M (Advanced Power Management), three levels of power saving can be set. If grayed out, the disk does not supported APM. For modern disks APM should probably be disable.</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low</strong> - Low power saving, higher performance, can't spindown</li>
<li><strong>Med</strong> - Medium power savings and performance, can spindown</li>
<li><strong>High</strong> - Higher power savings, lower performance, can spindown</li>
<li><strong>Disable</strong> - disables APM</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Spindown</strong> - You can enter the number of minutes of disk inactivity after which it will enter standby mode, stopping spinning. If services are using the disk, it might not be possible to spin it down. This depends on how the service uses the disk. Also, when packages are installed on disk and are running, the disk where the package was installed might not be put in standby; again, it depends on the service that the package offers. You have to press the <strong>Submit</strong> button for this to take effect.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Swapping on USB devices: </strong> <em>Enable</em> if you want to enable 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging" target="_blank">swapping</a> on USB devices.
<ul>
<li>By default swapping is not enabled on USB attached flash pens or disks,
as it will degrade performance and can shorten the life of the USB flash pen 
(which has a limited number of write cycles).</li>
<li>Swap <strong>is necessary</strong> and is enabled for internal disks,
that must have a swap partition as its first partition.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Swap aggressiveness: </strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness" target="_blank">Swappiness</a> specifies how aggressively swap is used, with 0 almost disabling it and 100 actively using it. The minimum value of 10 is sometimes recommended to improve performance when sufficient memory exists in a system. Swap is needed but might force disks spinup.<br>
