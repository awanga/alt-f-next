<title>Alt-F Packages Help</title>
</head><body>

<center><h2>Alt-F Package Manager Help</h2></center>

<p>This page allows you to add functionalities to Alt-F, by downloading packages from the
Internet and installing them on disk.
<p>You need a working internet connection; if you need to use a proxy server, set it first using
Setup->Proxy.

<p>On the first time you reach the page you will be asked where on disk you want to install the
packages. After you select a filesystem, a directory called 'Alt-F' (not 'alt-f', case is
 significant) will be created and the 'ipkg' package will be downloaded and installed.

<p>You will then be presented with a list of pre-installed, installed and available packages that you can update, remove or install.
You can read the simplified description of the package functionality and visit the package
homepage for further information.

<p>You can install and remove packages by hitting the corresponding buttons.
Many packages depends on others, and all needed packages will be automatically installed.

<p>You can't remove a package that is needed by others, you have to remove the main package first.

<p>When the "remove" button for a package is greyed out, it means that the package is pre-installed on the firmware and can't be uninstalled; when updating that package the "remove" button becomes enabled.

<p>Removing a package does not necessary means a fresh start, as some configuration files
are not removed; for a really fresh start you have to remove all packages and restart anew.
The "RemoveAll" button is intended for that purpose, but it might fail at first, use it right after a reboot.

<p>You can also install all available packages, which is not recommended, and remove all installed
packages.

<p>From time to time new packages are made available or existing packages are updated. For the
changes to appear, you have to hit the <em>UpdateList</em> button. When a package is Updated, its
configuration files are not lost, so you don't loose your settings.

<p>Some packages, mostly those that are for direct user usage, have administrative web pages.
Depending on the package functionality, you will find its web page under Services->Network,
System or User; in same cases the package web page will be accessed though one of the main menus,
look for changes there.

<p>The packages administrative web pages are simple by nature and design, trying to cover
the most frequent needs. You can also edit the packages configuration files directly,
if you dare. It is not however guaranteed that your manual changes will be recognized
or preserved by the administrative web pages if you use them afterwards.

<p>In the "Configure Feeds" section you can change the address of the packages origin, in case
you want to setup your own package feed; if you mess it up, you can recover the original package
feeds by hitting the DefaultFeed button.<br>
